# ClubSite - CS Club Project

This is a frontend-only React project aimed at creating a simple website for our CS Club. The goal is to get the web page working with basic navigation and styling before moving forward with additional features.

## ðŸš€ Current Features:
- **React Router:** Allows smooth navigation between pages like About, Events, and Contact.
- **CSS Styling:** Basic design to make the website visually appealing.
- **Navbar:** Functional navigation bar with React Router, enabling easy access to different sections.

## ðŸ”§ What's still in progress:
- **Backend:** The project is purely frontend for now, with no backend implemented yet.
- **About Page:** Adding details about the CS Club and its mission.
- **Contact Page:** A simple contact form for reaching out to the club.
- **Event Page:** Space to list upcoming events and club activities.
- **Slide Show:** Planned feature to highlight key events or club news.
- **Database:** Data is currently hard-coded; future plans involve integrating a backend and database for dynamic content.

This project serves as a starting point for building the frontend, and future updates will focus on integrating it with a full-stack solution.

Feel free to explore and check out my other project where I used the **MERN** stack to build a full-stack application!
